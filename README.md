# google-form-clone

A simple clone of Google Forms built using React. This project allows users to create, manage, and submit forms online, mimicking core functionalities of Google Forms with an intuitive, user-friendly interface.
Features
1. Form Creation

    Users can create forms with various question types:
        Multiple Choice
        Short Answer
        Paragraph
        Checkboxes
        Dropdown
        File Upload
    Add, edit, or remove questions in the form.
    Form title and description fields for easy identification.
    Basic theme customization for form appearance.

2. Form Response Collection

    Responses are stored and displayed in a structured database.
    Real-time response updates visible to form creators.
    View responses in a summarized format (pie charts, bar graphs for multiple choice answers).
    Option to export responses as CSV.

3. User Authentication (Optional)

    Option for user login via OAuth2 (e.g., Google or Facebook authentication).
    Secure handling of user data and form management.

4. Responsive Design

    Fully responsive design that adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

5. Public and Private Forms

    Forms can be set to public (anyone with the link can respond) or private (requires invitation).
    Restrict form responses to specific email addresses or authenticated users.

Technologies Used

    Frontend:
        React.js for building the dynamic user interface.
        CSS and Material UI for styling and responsive design.

    Backend:
        Node.js with Express.js for server-side logic (if applicable).
        MongoDB or Firebase for storing form data and responses.
        JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication (if implemented).

    Deployment:
        Frontend deployed on Netlify or Vercel.
        Backend hosted on Heroku or similar platforms (if applicable).

Phase 2 (Future Plans)
1. Advanced Form Logic

    Implement conditional logic to show/hide questions based on previous answers.
    Add branching logic for personalized forms.

2. User Management

    Allow form creators to collaborate with others, enabling multi-user access and editing.
    Implement granular permissions for collaborators (e.g., view, edit, delete).

3. Form Templates

    Offer pre-designed form templates for common use cases (e.g., surveys, event registration, feedback).

4. Notifications

    Send email or push notifications when a form is submitted or certain responses are received.
    Allow form creators to configure custom alerts.

5. Custom Branding

    Enable form creators to customize the form's look and feel, including branding elements like logos, colors, and fonts.

6. File Handling & Integration

    Enhance file upload capabilities with support for larger file sizes and more file types.
    Integration with cloud storage services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox).

7. API Integration

    Provide an API to allow third-party integrations (e.g., syncing form data with other applications).
